# single_cell_perturbations

This repository contains the code for a deeplearning project focused on [Single cell perturbations prediction]. The project includes scripts for data checking, feature extraction, embedding data analysis, and the main execution script. Additionally, it contains a `models` directory with different neural network architectures.

## Files Description

- `datachecker.py`: This script checks and validates the data used in the project.
- `embedding_data_analysis.py`: Responsible for analyzing the embedded data.
- `feature_extraction.py`: Extracts features from the dataset necessary for model training.
- `main.py`: The main script that runs the project, including training, evaluation, and testing phases.
- `train_eval_test.py`: Contains functions for training, evaluating, and testing models.

## Models Directory

The `models` directory includes various neural network architectures:
- `CNN.py`: Convolutional Neural Network model.
- `transformer.py`: Transformer model.
- `DenseNet.py`: DenseNet model.
- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the models module.
